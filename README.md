## Introduction
### This began as a joke. I tried some VS Code "AI" plugin and saw that it was using 1GB+ of ram, and was essentially an autocomplete/intelisense ranked by popularity. (Btw, popularity as measured from those coders who ticked the box to share their code with M$. Is that a cohort from whom we should draw our inspiritaion?). I quipped to a friend that I could probably knock out something better under an hour. He double daired me to try and this was the result.

50 lines in 30 minutes (originaly), that interfaced with howdoi (which interfaces with Google... that indexes stackexchange, which houses the information created by many humans, that lived in the house that Jack built. Phew!) But it turned out to have far more utility than I had expected. It really was very useful for learning new programming languages, or knocking out a script in a language I'd never used before. It was greater than the sum of its parts. I would liken it to the electric car: Google is the lithium/ion chemistry, howdoi is the battery, and helpmecode is the Tesla (well, I did say it was joke ;).

## Instructions

1. python3 server.py

2. If you have not done so already, install v1.1~ of www.autohotkey.com

3. If python is on a different machine, edit helpmecode.ahk to include its IP address

4. Open helpmecode.ahk

* Query history and error messages are sent to python terminal.

* If you share the python server between clients, you may benefit slightly from the shared cache.
