#### Rewrite helpmecode.ahk for linux as a helpmecode.py and use autokey instead of ahk.  

To rewrite the `helpmecode.ahk` script for Linux, we'll need to create a new Python script that uses the `autokey` library. This will involve translating the functionality of the original AutoHotKey script into Python, and making use of the `autokey` library's features to replicate the hotkey functionality.

Here's a basic outline of the steps we'll need to take:

1. Create a new Python script named `helpmecode.py`.
2. Import the necessary libraries (`socket`, `autokey`, etc.).
3. Define a function to connect to the server.
4. Define a function to send a query to the server.
5. Define a function to receive a response from the server.
6. Use `autokey` to set up hotkeys that trigger these functions.

Here's a basic example of how the new `helpmecode.py` script might look:

```python
helpmecode.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL

=======
import socket
import autokey

# Set up a socket connection to the server
def connect_to_server(ip_address, port):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((ip_address, port))
    return s

# Send a query to the server
def send_query(s, query):
    s.sendall(query.encode())

# Receive a response from the server
def receive_response(s):
    data = s.recv(1024)
    return data.decode()

# Set up hotkeys
api = autokey.iomediator.Interface()
hotkey = autokey.iomediator.Hotkey(["<ctrl>", "<alt>", "h"], send_query)
api.hotkeys.append(hotkey)
api.run()
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

This is a very basic example and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you might need to add additional functions to handle different types of queries, or to handle errors and exceptions. You might also need to adjust the hotkey setup to match the specific hotkeys you want to use.
